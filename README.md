# TimeClientUDP
This java application queries the number of seconds since the beginning of 1900 from the "time.nist.gov" server and converts it to the current time and date. 
It's the first project in my computer networks class to demonstrate my understanding of UDP packets and it's interactions with the client and server side in a network.
